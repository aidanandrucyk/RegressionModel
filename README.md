# Regression Model ToolKit

Independently built java application that uses least-squares approximation to generate a linear regression model given explanatory variables, synthesizing concepts from linear algebra and statistics to output the least-squares-regression-line equation, covariance matrix, and coefficients of correlation and determination. 
Created the GUI using the JavaFX library as well as CSS for styling and Gluon’s SceneBuilder for handling FXML.
Approximately >2,000 lines of code between Java, CSS, and FXML files.

The extensive explanation of the project can be found under the [RegressionReport](https://github.com/aidanandrucyk/RegressionModel/tree/master/RegressionReport) folder.
