      <TextArea prefHeight="600.0" prefWidth="800.0" text="MULTIVARIABLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL&#10;Aidan M. Andrucyk, Honors College Student at Rutgers University-New Brunswick Class of 2023&#10;&#10;Purpose: This personal project affords the opportunity to synthesize prior academic knowledge from disciplines including linear algebra, statistics, and computer science while also applying newfound knowledge gained from further investigation. &#10;&#10;Abstract: The program uses least squares approximation to generate a linear regression model with response variable ŷ and multiple user-specified predictor variables inputted through an excel file, text file, or directly onto the GUI. &#10;&#10;Background: This background guide assumes a foundational understanding of linear algebra on the readers part, but attempts to offer extensive explanations of each component. This background guide will also be preferential towards bivariate conditions due to their simplicity in implementation, intuitive geometric interpretation, and overall ease of understanding for the reader. &#10;&#10;Foundational concepts must be understood prior to delineating specifics of the program:&#10;&#10;Pure Mathematics&#10;Matrix:&#10;Vector:&#10;Matrix Multiplication:&#10;Dot Product:&#10;Transpose:&#10;Inverse:&#10;Cofactor Expansion:&#10;Adjugate (Cofactor Matrix)&#10;Partial Derivatives&#10;Statistics&#10;Explanatory Variable:&#10;Responsive Variable:&#10;Residuals:&#10;sample mean (y bar)&#10;Confounding Variable ?&#10;Covariance Matrix:&#10;A high correlation coefficient does not necessarily imply that there is a casual relationship.&#10;&#10;Least squares approximation effectively finds the mathematical relationship between the parameter(s) and responsive variable that minimizes the mean squared error or summation of the squared residuals. This relationship is expressed as a least squares regression line or, colloquially, a line of best fit. The formula is as follows ŷ = a0 + a1x1 + … + akxk, where k equals the number of predictor variables, &#10;&#10;The following is a simple, yet instructive conceptual derivation of the least squares approximation with a single explanatory variable:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;However, this program expands upon data data which is contingent upon two variables, and &#10;&#10;&#10;Multiple regressions are based on the assumption that there is a linear relationship between both the dependent and independent variables. It also assumes no major correlation between the independent variables.&#10;&#10;Demonstration:&#10;&#10;Practical Applications: Provides the ability to predict a given response variable&#10;The following is a short list of potential real-world applications:&#10;Predicting the price of a home in a given location with predictor(s) of construction year, lot size, number of rooms, etc.&#10;Extrapolating the average yearly temperature in a given region with predictor(s) CO2, Ranching (Methane), etc.&#10;https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resident-population-by-ethnicity-gender-and-age-group?view_id=8ff89d3f-48c8-46e4-8a4d-a8b9f152976f&amp;resource_id=f9dbfc75-a2dc-42af-9f50-425e4107ae84&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Stylistic Choices:&#10;Rounds to the nearest thousandths place for covariance matrices and at the end of the least square approximation only. &#10;Excessively long values might hinder readability and adversely affect the user experience, especially if a single LRSL equation is spanning several lines. The thousandths place provides relatively precise data without sacrificing a large degree of insight. &#10;The use of the double data type to hold values leads to imperfect precision in certain operations, particularly with irrational numbers. For instance, the fraction 4/21 is different from a double storing the value corresponding to 4 divided by 21 which is 0.19047619047619047. The error derives from the double data type’s lack of storage availability for the full value. Although this may seem negligible for a single operation, several operations like this compounding on each other may lead to some imprecision which is often the case with least square approximations. With a simple data set such as [(1,14), (3, 17), (5, 19), (7, 20)], an exact LSRL would be ŷ = 13.5 + 1.0x1 whereas an algorithm storing imprecise double values outputs ŷ = 13.499999999999998 + 1.0x1. Rounding to the thousandths solves specific cases such as the aforementioned data set. &#10;Rounding at the end of processes prevents premature rounding from distorting data integrity. &#10;One unimplemented solution could be the fractional storage of values in an object with two attributes: a numerator double and a denominator double. There are a number of libraries that afford this capability. However, the marginal cost of this implementation far exceeds the additional marginal insight added. &#10;Creating a certain static “make[insert class attribute variable]” methods in the RegressionModel class rather than deriving all attributes within the constructor so as to enhance readability with clearer connections to in-line annotations.&#10;Ordering method arguments in descending memory allocation order. &#10;Distinguishing vectors as one-dimensional arrays and matrices as two-dimensional arrays. Although possible to allocate vectors as a two-dimensional array of row/column length one, vectors are instead allocated with double[] for memory but largely aesthetic and personal cognition reasons.&#10;Avoiding the use of the term “sigma” to avoid confusion.&#10;Denoting the square root of mean squared error (MSE) as “Standard Deviation” rather than lowercase sigma .&#10;Denoting running sums as “sums of...” rather than “sigma of…” or Σ.&#10;Multi-line comments, capitalized letter first word, and periods for annotations as long or longer than three lines; end-line comments, uncapitalized letters, and no periods for annotations shorter than three lines.&#10;&#10;Acknowledgements:&#10;Lasantha Goonetilleke, Assistant Professor of the Mathematics Department at Rutgers University&#10;Bari Leff, AP Statistics Teacher at East Brunswick High School&#10;&#10;Works Consulted:&#10;Lawrence A.
